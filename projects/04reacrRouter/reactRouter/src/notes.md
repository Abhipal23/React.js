### React Router :
   in this we will see react router which is 3rd party lib of react 
   




### Link and NavLink 
  link we used in place of anchor tag as when we use a  tag it our whole 
   page will be refresh 
   and in react there is no concept of refresh that's why we use link tag
   as dom goes and update the existing dom with changes

  so we use link in place of a tag it provide all those attributes

    in link 
    <Link to ="acts as hrf"> <Link>

## NavLink 
    it pro some additional things compare to link
