  # uinique client id.secreat,passwords
  # as react is frontend lib and all the things written in react will be shipped  in broweser via javaScript, there are ways we can get that data 


  ## that's why we need some system varaiables 

  # when we deploy our application in pri\oduction ,there we get a screat manager there these varables will be copied


  # always keep in mind enviornment variable should in root of application,ex: readMe....
  # extension .env
