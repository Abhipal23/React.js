# props:
   ### props are used to make components reuseble 
     generally in a web page we make 3 diff files html,css,js
     but React said don't segerate things on bases of technologies
     segerate based on their work
    
    card which we have taken make all thing in same so,later on we can use it as reusable components


    Note:Props are arguments passed into React components.
         props stands for properties.
         The component receives the argument as a props object:
         we can pass variable and props have access
